# dcfg - distribute config.
Simple tool for storing and distributing your config files (dotfiles) with git support.

## How to use:
some directory is required to use dcfg for storing your config and dot files. 
I hope you would have one! Let's say, for example, that it will be `/home/user/dotfiles/`.
Then you need to create dcfg config file. You may do this on your own (`touch dcfg.conf`) or
execute
`dcfg init`
